# Iterator Helpers Polyfill

This is a polyfill for [Iterator Helpers Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/) .
It is independend (doesn't have any dependecies) and can be used in enviroments supporting es 2018 standart.
<!-- I dont know what to write else here lol -->

## Notes:
It also implements behavior from [issue #114 - flatMap should act like it does a `yield *` on each iterable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/issues/114)
